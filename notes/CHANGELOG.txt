New Content:
Added "Unique" category to Runecrafting
Added Ancient Staff.

Bug Fixes:
Elemental Runes are apparently unable to count as a substitute for runes without some freaky code finagling, and so have been changed to do something different (see Balance Changes).
Eyes of the Elements accidentally gave +40 Maximum Hit to their respective elements. This has been changed to +20.

Balance Changes:
Changed Elemental Rune into a Consumable item and renamed into Fragmented Elemental Rune.
Equip requirements for Elementalist Gear have been increased from 75 -> 80
Equip requirements for Orb of the Elements have been decreased from 75 -> 60
Equip requirements for Elemental Tomes have been decreased from 70 -> 50
Upgrade requirements for Elementalist Gear has been changed to require Ancient Wizard Gear, and x10 the Gem Dust cost.
Orb of the Elements now requires 500 Fragmented Elemental Runes (increased from 100).
Added Ancient Staff to Magic Chest drop table.
Dungeon Monsters in Elemental Sanctuary have been heavily nerfed.
