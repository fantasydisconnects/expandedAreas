New Content:
Added Tome of the Elements as a Runecrafting recipe
Added 4 new Standard Spells
Added 1 new Rune

Bug Fixes:
Added missing images for Glacia God Set (P)
Fixed the Pure Elementalist Set (all pieces were previously considered Helmetsâ€”oops!)
Increased the Magic Minimum Hit values of all the Elementalist Gear (previously, they were outperformed by the Expert Robes!!! I've really gotta stop working while tired)

Balance Changes:
The Glacia God Set and Glacia God Set (P) have had their Melee Defence bonuses increased to be equal to an untrimmed set of Rune Armour, to account for Combat Triangle as well as to contest with the Elementalist Gear that was added
Changed rarity of the Ancient Staff to be roughly the same rarity as the Ancient Wizard Hat
Changed Pure Elementalist Sceptre to require 1 Orb of the Elements instead of 5000 Diamond Dust, and increased Pureform Rune cost from 5 -> 10
Decreased Glacia God Set (P) Pureform Rune cost from 50 -> 25
Changed the Elementalist Set from being an Upgrade to being a Runecrafting recipe
Added Elemental Pages as possible drops from Runecrafting, scaling with level
Changed Elemental Tomes' Pages cost from 500 -> 300
