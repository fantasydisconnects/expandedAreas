Bug Fixes:
Added missing images for Glacia God Set (P)
Fixed the Pure Elementalist Set (all pieces were previously considered Helmetsâ€”oops!)
Increased the Magic Minimum Hit values of all the Elementalist Gear (previously, they were outperformed by the Expert Robes!!! I've really gotta stop working while tired)

Balance Changes:
The Glacia God Set and Glacia God Set (P) have had their Melee Defence bonuses increased to be equal to an untrimmed set of Rune Armour, to account for Combat Triangle as well as to contest with the Elementalist Gear that was added.
